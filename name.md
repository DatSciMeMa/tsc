# Bitol - What's in the name?

Bitol represents this constant iterative process that symbolizes evolution. A Mayan sky god, Bitol is one of the creator and destroyer deities who participated in the last two attempts at creating humanity. They attempted to form sentient creatures at the beginning of days with their associates: Alom, Qaholom, and Tzacol. In the third creation (or iteration), they were transformed into Ixmacane.
